## Metamodel Based Optimization

After obtaining the reference data (exhaustive evaluation), we build __GPR__ and __NN__ meta-models and apply optimization methods. We partition the data as *25-75*, *50-50*, and *75-25* percent to train-test the meta-models and then apply optimization on each obtained meta-model.
